# Server-Side Include Substitute (ssis)
#
# Version 1.1.3 - August 1, 1995 - Removed the need for cgi-lib.pl
# Version 1.1.2 - May 9, 1995 - Slight documentation chages - GEB
# Version 1.1.1 - Mar 10, 1995 - modified it to work if . isn't in path - GNS
# Version 1.1 - Mar 3, 1995
# Version 1.0 - Mar 1, 1995
#
# This script is meant to allow server-side include functionality without
# *actually* using server-side includes.  It does this by running as a
# CGI program, and parsing the pages itself.

#
# Usage:
#
#  Put this program in the directory where you put your CGI programs.
#  Call the program like this:
#
#   http://www.site.edu/cgi-bin/your_dir/ssis/~username/the_page_you_want.html
#
#  This will send the document
#
#   http://www.site.edu/~username/the_page_you_want.html
#
#  except it will handle the server-side includes.
#
#  If you're using the CERN server, you can have the server map the URL
#  into the proper format by putting this in your httpd.conf file:
#
#    Map /dir/filename.html /cgi-bin/ssis/dir/filename.html
#
#  which will map any requests transparently onto the ssis script URL.
#
###########################################################################
#
# Bugs:
#
#  Right now it will only handle the <!--#exec cgi="program"--> server-
#  side includes.  This limitation will be removed shortly.

# The following GUESSES where the cgi-bin directory is on the assumption
# that this script is called with an absolute path.
